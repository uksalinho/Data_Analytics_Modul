(The problems and subjects in this part, has been prepared especially for you to equip yourself for the interview process and improve your coding skills.
To get the most from this part, it’s highly recommended to be prepared and present the topics in German / English.
At first, it can be difficult to present in German / English and you can read from your notes, no problem.
We strongly advise you to force yourself to present especially the interview questions in German / English.
However, if you don’t feel you can present in German / English, you can do any part in Turkish, that’s no problem too.
Please remember; we don’t want to put extra pressure to anyone, it’s totally up to you how you prepare for this section.
The main and only aim of this part is to develop your skills that you need during and after the recruitment process and make you ready for the DS career.)
