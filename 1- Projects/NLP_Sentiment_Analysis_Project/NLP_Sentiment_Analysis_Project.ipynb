Text Mining\n","\n","Text is the most unstructured form of all the available data, therefore various types of noise are present in it. This means that the data is not readily analyzable without any pre-processing. The entire process of cleaning and standardization of text, making it noise-free and ready for analysis is known as **text preprocessing**.\n","\n","The three key steps of text preprocessing:\n","\n","- **Tokenization:**\n","This step is one of the top priorities when it comes to working on text mining. Tokenization is essentially splitting a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or an entire text document into smaller units, such as individual words or terms. Each of these smaller units are called tokens.\n","\n","- **Noise Removal:**\n","Any piece of text which is not relevant to the context of the data and the end-output can be specified as the noise.\n","For example – language stopwords (commonly used words of a language – is, am, the, of, in etc), URLs or links, upper and lower case differentiation, punctuations and industry specific words. This step deals with removal of all types of noisy entities present in the text.\n","\n","\n","- **Lexicon Normalization:**\n","Another type of textual noise is about the multiple representations exhibited by single word.\n","For example – “play”, “player”, “played”, “plays” and “playing” are the different variations of the word – “play”. Though they mean different things, contextually they all are similar. This step converts all the disparities of a word into their normalized form (also known as lemma). \n","There are two methods of lexicon normalisation; **[Stemming or Lemmatization](https://www.guru99.com/stemming-lemmatization-python-nltk.html)**. Lemmatization is recommended for this case, because Lemmatization as this will return the root form of each word (rather than just stripping suffixes, which is stemming).\n","\n","As the first step change text to tokens and convertion all of the words to lower case.  Next remove punctuation, bad characters, numbers and stop words. The second step is aimed to normalization them throught the Lemmatization method. \n","\n","\n","***Note:*** *Use the functions of the ***[nltk Library](https://www.guru99.com/nltk-tutorial.html)*** for all the above operations.*\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vH7TYkFEyaaf"},"source":["### Tokenization, Noise Removal, Lexicon Normalization"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"9bbvWQE_yaah"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Wl2p1vRoyaah"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_DTNRasaCV3-"},"source":["## 4.
