(The problems and subjects in this part, has been prepared especially for you to equip yourself for the interview process and improve your coding skills. 
To get the most from this part, it’s highly recommended to be prepared and present the topics in English / German.

We strongly advise you to force yourself to present especially the interview questions in English / German. 
However, if you don’t feel you can present in English / German, you can do any part in Turkish, that’s no problem too.
